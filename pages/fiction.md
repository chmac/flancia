Our plans are our fictions; some come into being in the face of horrible odds. We live in an unlikely universe.

I think we should communicate with each other over the internet, embrace this technology with honesty, and try to work it out. Think of ways of advancing culture, technology and human happiness.

"Great idea", I hear you think. "You just had an obvious thought and wrote about it."

Well, here you are. You are with me here, and you think this is obvious. But a lot of people don't. They didn't get here, or they got here and didn't read this far. What I say is obvious to you, but perhaps not to them.
