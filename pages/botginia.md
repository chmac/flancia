I made a simple Twitter bot that posts lines from Virginia Woolf's works: 
[@botginia](https://twitter.org/botginia). 

I have long been a fan and her turns of phrase are just so beautiful. One of the best writers I've read.

Unsure what the "right" cadence for posting would be. Currently set to run once a day, around 9PM CET.

I'd like to eventually get her to be more sophisticated:

 * Score phrases using heuristics.
 * Generate phrases not actually present in the corpus.
   * Train a simple generative model.
   * Fine tune GPT-2 or BERT.

Code is at [github](https://github.com/flancian/botginia).
