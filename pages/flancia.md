I always assumed that, when people dedicated books, they first wrote the book and then wrote the dedication. It would mean dedicating the book as a finished object, a concrete thing, something that one has finished and can fully offer.

Now I realize I'm not that kind of person, and I need to write its dedication half way. At the point in which I know where I'm going, but not whether I will ever get there.

Writing this half way means dedicating a set of ideas only; an aspiration. It is only appropriate, then, to dedicate ideas to ideas and not explicitly to people. Nouns in the vocative or the dative case.

To you, my readers; to my *friends*.
