I always assumed that, when people dedicated books, they all first wrote the book and then wrote the dedication. It would mean dedicating the book as a finished object, a concrete thing, something that one has finished and can fully offer.

I've come to realize I'm not that kind of person, and I need to dedicate a draft. Whatever it is you're currently reading: a booklet, a place, a website; not even half done.

Writing this now means dedicating a set of ideas only; an aspiration. It is only appropriate, then, to dedicate ideas to ideas and not to individual people.

To my friends. 

To you.

Welcome to Flancia! It is both a place and a draft. Not fully cogent, but honest. Feel free to play [hopscotch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_(Cort√°zar_novel)#"Table_of_Instructions"_and_structure).
