This page is about possible implementations of the [Agora](/agora). I hope, in time, it will evolve into a detailed plan.

For the time being, this is what I have:

# Wiki
I think I'll set up a Wiki -- any Wiki will do, but eventually I'd like to extend it to implement features, and for that reason I'd like to use a Wiki engine based on Python (v3 ideally). I know and like Python. You have to use what you have.
