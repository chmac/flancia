Flancia is free in the GNU-approved meaning of the word, and of course comes without any warranty. Use at your own risk.

It is also, of course, open source. This is where your stuff would be if you wanted to contribute to Flancia.

It's just a static page for now because I haven't set it up otherwise. I'll do it if I ever get a pull request for this page (and move your stuff after if needed). I intend not to postpone *too* much making the repository public, even if people are not likely to use it.

Or if you prefer just send me an email. That sounds easier to start with.
