I run a lightweight implementation of Go Links on the /go/ URL space. Basically anything under <https://flancia.org/go/> is a redirect to a URL somewhere on the internet. Think of it as open, lightweight social bookmarking.

The Go Links idea is very popular in many companies. It originated at Google. I think it might catch on in the wider internet as well.

If you'd like to implement Go Links on your domain, there's two ways I could currently recommend. Read on.

# Use HTTP redirects.

The geekier way. Simplest and quickest to set up if you like stuff like writing your own Apache/Nginx configs. Basically just set up redirects in /go/, done.

TODO: link my live nginx configuration/redirect list?

# Use Trotto Go Links.

See <https://flancia.org/go/trotto> :)
