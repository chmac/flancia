Flancia is a set of simple algorithms. They run, not in a computer (not for now anyway), but somewhere else. In our minds.

It is, that is, a set of ideas -- like any other. Some are instructions, some are concepts. Some are true and some are false. I try to write only ideas that have some interesting probability to be true -- but I can only do my best. I'm sure a lot of bad ideas are around here; it is up to you to decide. I make no pretense of being perfect, that should be clear enough.

How do you build an utopia? Behind every problem there is a simple solution -- often an incomplete one.

To live in an utopia, first you agree with others on what an utopia is. Then you look for it around you. If what you see is not that utopia, you work with others on a plan to change the world -- some part of the world, to begin with -- into it. The plan can start simple, but you should add details later: like how to get the material resources to bankroll the utopia, and what do you do with people that have other ideas of an utopia than you. If you get the resources and enough people collaborate with you, you build it. Then you move there.

Flancia is the middle way: perhaps everybody over X should donate 50%.

The internet makes it possible to cut the middle man. Give money directly to others using your own principles. Just give it to other actual beings. It's up to you.

Flancia is the internet (a new tool) plus buddhism (an old tool).
