I've got plenty of drafts that I never finish, so I thought I'd just write something and post it right away for a change.

I guess my draft problem is an editing problem. I never sit down to edit -- it's not something that comes naturally to me. I like to write down quick ideas, I guess because writing something down gets me a quick fix. Polishing -- my writing, a piece of code, my shoes -- has never been my forte. It feels like actual work.

Just after you write something you get to feel sort of OK about all the mistakes that are in it. "It's just a quick draft, of course it's clunky". Excuses like this grow thinner once you've actually made an effort at something.
