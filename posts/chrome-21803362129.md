Inspired by an afternoon installing a VM running Windows XP, than then was a trip to the past. No access to the internet because of the lack of the latest security cyphers for HTTPS in a world that has mostly moved on by now (thankfully).

A short story about someone that downloads Chrome 218 by mistake, and gets access to the internet of the year 2043.
