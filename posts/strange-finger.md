[PKD](link://slug/gpt-pkd) generated this, IIRC as a failed prompt (I gave it a prompt and it seemed to ignore it). I liked it enough to post it. 

I might do this from time to time, and use the tag [ghostwritten](link://tag/ghostwritten) for such texts. This one has been edited lightly; I tried not to go too far and remove all the weirdness in it which I think is partly what makes it special/funny/whatever.
