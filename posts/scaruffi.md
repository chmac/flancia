File under "sites I'd really like to read, but I haven't read yet".

* [Scaruffi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Scaruffi)'s [site](https://www.scaruffi.com). He writes about many of the same topics I find interesting, and has been doing so for decades now.

<https://www.scaruffi.com/nature/> seems particularly interesting. That plus all his work on music.

This [New York Times's article on him](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/arts/15morr.html) is probably a good primer on the scope of his work, and may have been what originally got me interested in his work -- although I've been postponing diving into it for a while now, so who knows by now.
