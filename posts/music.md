This should be an easy one. An easy post, I mean. It's harder to put together the willpower to start with a post about an original idea. Music perhaps I can do.

I play a bit of piano. Really not much. I started "only" two years ago. I know only very basic stuff; a few simple songs, some classical, some pop. I'm self-teaching, which I'm sure really is as terrible an idea as people usually make it out to be. But I enjoy the feeling of teaching myself things, even if it's suboptimal. At least it doesn't seem impossible -- I feel like I'm (slowly) getting better, and I do seem to be getting a better understanding of music at some level, which is what I mainly set out to do I guess. I don't think I'll ever be a professional musician, of course, but then again I don't think I care. I'm fine with being an amateur (this will be a recurring assertion in this blog I'm sure, I should write a post about amateurism - or just make it my pseudonym?).

How self-serving is to write? Writing about oneself clearly is. But which writing is really not about oneself, or about what one has lived, or what one thinks or considers important?
