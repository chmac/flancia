On the other hand I'm pretty sure my other idea about the blockchain must be bullshit. I mean, it has 'blockchain' in it; I would assume dumb or scam the minute I saw it on any random blog, and I'm not sure why I should pretend of myself better standards. So I see it as an exercise in finding out why my intuition is wrong. It could be useful to think about the errors of reasoning I'm prone to.
