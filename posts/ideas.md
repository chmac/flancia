Continue writing that story set in Berlin after global warming. The heat is everywhere, everything is sticky; like Noir set in Los Angeles summer, but in Berlin in springtime.


Also: short story about going back to Argentina and realizing that Mariano plays his "very nerdy guy" character, An√≠bal, at university (when he teaches and interacts with other members of the faculty). It started when he played the character in Instagram, and he just kept at it. It got out of hand when he realized a future coworker followed him in IG. Scenes: I meet a common acquaintance and he reports him as being very serious and straight.
