How to beat procrastination: first, you have to decide to beat it. To do this, you better research known methods first -- then you'll be able to beat it more effectively, and you'll do what you have to do (the most important thing almost on your mind, the task not quite at hand) next.

Which you'll do right after you finish your research. It turns out there are several methods to beat procrastination, including but not limited to:

 - Organizational methods, like Getting Things Done. This one is promising, and that's such a good title -- that's what you want, you want to do things. Like the things you need to do. Which you'll do after digging a bit deeper.

You might as well download the ebook now, as it's better to go straight to the source of things when researching. The Kindle version on Amazon seems a bit expensive -- perhaps pirate it first then, test before you buy as they say, and libgen.io is so convenient -- it'll take a few minutes to get the right version that works on your Kindle, but then it'll be smooth sailing, or perhaps you'll have to fire off Calibre to convert an .epub to a .mobi (why did Amazon not include .mobi support?), but hold on, where is your Kindle again?
