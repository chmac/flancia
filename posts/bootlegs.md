Inspired by hearing a Rachmaninov recording for the first time (consciously at least).

A short story about a bootlegger in the year 2134 who ilegally travels back in time to record the great musicians in history. Alternatively, a simulation story of the same.

Interesting how time travel stories can yield simulation stories...
