Idea for corporation governance:

 * Employees vote on policy.
     * Googlers wouldn't have backed Google+ Real Names.
     * Googlers wouldn't have allowed ten messaging apps to develop and fester.
 * Eventually, policy is codified in such a way that we can use machine learning algorithms to develop expert systems that also vote on policy.
     * These expert systems are also trained on strategies from history, codified in such a way to be understood as equivalent to the corporate-level strategy that the company needs.
