I am starting a social network of sorts and I want to invite you to it. It is called [Stoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoa).

It is a social network for expression and thought -- like every social network, of course.

Here's how it works: people with similar interests and values agree on objectives. Then they work together towards them. In particular, groups can agree on problems that they think need solving, and they agree to work towards a solution.

The values part is important. People collaborate when they share values. Here, they can make them explicit. To be part of a group, you accept rules. Like in Reddit. People that break this set of values lose the right to participate in the group.

When I say values, I really mean values. Think gender equality. Equality in all shape of forms. Those are my particular values, and I want to invite people that share them to collaborate.

I am donating $500 a month to two people for a year. People that receive this grant are free to do whatever they want with it. Think about it as non-universal very humble basic income.

And here's the first objective: UBI.
