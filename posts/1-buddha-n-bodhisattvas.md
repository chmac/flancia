Buddha said: these are the paths and meanderings of the human mind. Come with me and I'll show you.

We are our thoughts and our actions. While you think like the Buddha you become the Buddha. While you act like the Buddha you become the Buddha.

Boddhisattvas say: I will walk with you, but no further than my friends who are in the path behind me. We will all meet each other there.
