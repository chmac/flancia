I've been thinking a lot about the [Agora](/agora). It seems crazy -- is it a trivial idea? I have a lot of those, and I write about them all, just in case. I write about my ideas as if they were fiction, because they likely *are* fiction; they don't work, or they are trivial to the point in which they are not really ideas at all; just thoughts about the world as it is, in some way, or after some trivial transformation. Shallow.

But about the Agora: what if it *were* true? What if we *could* build an Agora, right here, right now, on the internet? It seems doable enough: a website where we can all agree to discuss earnestly, not to bicker or put the other party down but to understand the other, learn from each other, perhaps sometimes indeed *convince* another? The rest of the internet could remain as is; bitter, divided, misguided, petty. But the Agora would try harder.

Is it trivial because it already exists? We have many sites that could work as an Agora: hackernews, reddit, stackoverflow, twitter. Even Facebook. But those sites aren't the Agora; the Agora is a social platform with extra rules that none of them have. The Agora is any social media, *with an intention*.

Or perhaps the issue is that those already exists, but I don't know about them because nobody uses it. Or because I'm an ignoramus.

But, really, even if that is the case, I want to write about it because I want to know where it is. If it is out there then please -- you, reader, if you ever exist -- point me to it. Because I want to get in there.
